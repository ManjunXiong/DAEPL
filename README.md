# Self-supervised diagnosis of rotating machinery faults using a deep convolutional probability network
This repository is the official implementation of Self-supervised diagnosis of rotating machinery faults using a deep convolutional probability network (DCPN).
# Abstract: 
Pattern recognition has been widely applied in machinery fault diagnostics. While, in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, with the high calculation complexity and massive memory occupancy, huge computational burden is inevitable. Moreover, prior knowledge is required for such traditional fault diagnosis methods , which usually an exhausting work for practical engineering applications. In this work, a deep convolutional probability network (DCPN) is proposed to serve for self-supervised diagnostics of rotating machinery faults. Based on a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder, vibration features are automatically extracted with less memory occupancy. A novel probability-based loss function integrating the traditional reconstruction loss and the probability-based triplet loss is proposed to improve the convergence speed of the feature selection. Under the self-supervision of the loss function, the convolutional features of the vibration signal are mapped to a low-dimensional space for diagnosing the possible fault pattern in a self-supervised fashion. A series of experiments show that the optimization method developed here significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and operation efficiency.
